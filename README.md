# iocage-plugin-piwigo

This is plugin to create Piwigo, an open source photo gallery software for the web. Designed for organisations, teams and individuals.

I have manage to test this couple of times on my TrueNAS 12.2, all seems to work well.

Sometimes during the first installation screen, when entering data regarding the database, db user and db password, Host: need to be replaced from localhost to 127.0.0.1
All data required for this first install-screen are saved in TrueNAS/Plugins/Piwigo/Post Install Notes.

Second tip is setting your own date and time location in PHP.INI, for standart setting I have used Europe/London ;)
